# 🌟 Python Programming Tasks — Level 1 & 2

Welcome to the **"Where Data Meets Intelligence"** Python mini-project series!  
This repository contains five tasks that demonstrate fundamental to intermediate programming concepts — from basic logic to persistent file storage.

Each task is fully documented, modular, and written in **clean, beginner-friendly Python**.

## 📂 **File Overview**

| File Name | Level | Task Title | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `Task_1.py` | Level 1 | Basic Text-Based Game | A simple number guessing game using conditional statements. |
| `Task_2.py` | Level 1 | Number Pattern Generator | Prints numeric pyramid patterns using nested loops. |
| `Task_3.py` | Level 2 | Console-Based CRUD Application | Performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a list of tasks. |
| `Task_4.py` | Level 2 | Temperature Converter | Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user choice. |
| `Task_5.py` | Level 2 | Persistent CRUD Application | Extends Task 3 by saving tasks to a text file using file I/O operations. |

## 🧩 **Task Details**

### 🕹️ **Task_1.py — Text-Based Game**
**Objective:** Implement a simple game using conditional statements.  
**Description:**  
- The computer selects a random number between 1 and 20.  
- The player must guess it within 5 attempts.  
- The game provides feedback ("Too high" / "Too low").  
**Concepts Used:**  
Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`), loops, random module, input handling.

---

### 🔢 **Task_2.py — Number Pattern Generator**
**Objective:** Generate and print numeric patterns using loops.  
**Description:**  
- Creates a pyramid-shaped number pattern based on user input.  
- Demonstrates nested loops and formatted spacing.  
**Concepts Used:**  
Nested `for` loops, iteration, formatted printing.

---

### 🗂️ **Task_3.py — Basic CRUD Task Manager**
**Objective:** Create a console app to manage tasks.  
**Description:**  
- Users can **add**, **view**, **update**, or **delete** tasks.  
- Data is stored in a list during runtime.  
**Concepts Used:**  
Lists, classes, functions, input/output, conditional logic, loops.

---

### 🌡️ **Task_4.py — Temperature Converter**
**Objective:** Convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  
**Description:**  
- Users input a temperature value.  
- Choose conversion direction (C ➜ F or F ➜ C).  
- Result is displayed with precision.  
**Concepts Used:**  
Functions, arithmetic operations, control flow, exception handling.

---

### 💾 **Task_5.py — Persistent CRUD Task Manager**
**Objective:** Store and retrieve task data using file I/O.  
**Description:**  
- Enhances Task 3 by saving task data in `tasks.txt`.  
- Automatically loads saved tasks at program start.  
- Handles file creation and errors gracefully.  
**Concepts Used:**  
File handling (`read`, `write`), exception handling, lists, classes, persistence.

---

## 🧠 **Skills Demonstrated**
- **Programming Fundamentals** (loops, conditionals, functions)  
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (Task class)  
- **File I/O and Data Persistence**  
- **Error Handling and Input Validation**  
- **Console Interaction and Modular Design**

---

## 🧰 **Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- No external libraries required (uses only built-in modules)

---

## ▶️ **How to Run**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
2. Navigate to the project folder.  
3. Run any task using:
   ```bash
   python Task_1.py
   ```
   *(Replace `Task_1.py` with any other task file name.)*
